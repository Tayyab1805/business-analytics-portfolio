## Detailed Notes

### 1. Systems of Linear Equations
Used when multiple conditions must be satisfied simultaneously.

**General Form:**
a₁x + b₁y = c₁
a₂x + b₂y = c₂

**Business Application:**
- Production planning with constraints
- Resource allocation
- Market equilibrium analysis

### 2. Matrix Algebra in Business
#### 2.1 Matrix Representation
Business data often organized in matrices:

**Example - Sales Data:**
